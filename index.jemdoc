I am currently a second year CS PhD student at University of Southern California in the [https://viterbi-web.usc.edu/~cstheory/ CS Theory Group] and [https://sites.usc.edu/razaviyayn/group/ ODDS Group] where I am advised by [https://sites.usc.edu/razaviyayn/ Meisam Razaviyayn] and [https://vatsalsharan.github.io/ Vatsal Sharan]. I am broadly interested in working on fundamental problems in Optimization and Differential Privacy. Before joining USC, I recieved a B.Tech in Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence from IIIT Delhi. \n
